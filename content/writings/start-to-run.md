I have always dream of running long distances.

I think Casey Neistat had an influence on me. Seeing him run long distances and run marathons made we want to do it as well.

I have been trying to run since a decade now.
I used to start, get tired in the first 5 minutes, then give up.
So when I said I would go for a run, I would be back home in 15 minutes.

This post is a documentation of how I could run 5 kilometers.

I would always prefer gym and strength training over endurance stuff like running. And I didn't really care if I could not run longer. I was lifting well in the gym so that was my win.

One more thing that added up to my reasons to not run was a small hit on the knee when I was learning to surf 2 years ago. After this incident, any time I tried running outdoors, my right knee would flare up within 10 mins and I would limp my way back home.

But now, not being able to run became a limitation in my mind.

On a random Friday morning, I went out for a run and the same repeated even after 2 years. I had to carry this knee flare up for the whole day.

It felt it was time to get consulted and the sports physio proved my lower body mobility, especially for the right ankle, is bad. And due to this, my right knee was taking up more load than it should. I started to work on it.

Couple of days later, I was chatting with my friends after having dinner together and I was telling them this story. Ibraheem told his story about how he ran 24km and how hard it is to run slow.

**It never crossed my mind that I could run slow.**

We even did a small run-check on how slow 12 min/km pace is my knee wasn't acting. This was a revelation for me.

I think this hustle mentality and the notion that things should be hard was consistent in my head. It immediately reminded me of this post from Derek - [Relax for the same Result](https://sive.rs/relax). Things clicked.

I was chasing an experienced runner's pace.

Next day morning, I made my first PR of running 5km at around 12:15 pace. I will be proud of this Strava entry for some time. I hope that time is a short period and keep impressing myself.
