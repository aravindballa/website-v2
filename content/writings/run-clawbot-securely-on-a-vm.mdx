Yes, people are buying Mac Minis for their clawdbots ([@openclaw](https://x.com/openclaw)) to operate in.

Which is understandable, actually.

It gets its own environment to act in. Any fuckups wont hamper your personal data. This is also the reason to give it its own email, a phone number and things like a github account etc.

This kind of isolation is not possible when you want to not buy a machine for it but run it directly on your own computer. There are a lot of risks of letting AI wild on your data, especially when it is also your work computer.

So, I tried running it in a Ubuntu VM, using [@OrbStack](https://x.com/OrbStack), and it worked wonderfully.

Because it's Ubuntu, we have a good development environment for claude code to run in.

I first installed claude code and authenticated. Then started the setup for clawdbot using the install script.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://molt.bot/install.sh | bash
```

Setting it up was straightforward for the most part. It was missing cli tools like homebrew (obv as it is not macos) but they aren't really necessary.

Orbstack has a really nice UX for opening up the terminal of the VM and running commands. So the setup, pairing for channels, and the later config was all smooth.

## Limitations

A main drawback with is approach is that it is not macos. So you wouldn't have things like iMessages, Apple Notes, Things (macos only note taking app), etc.

And keeping it always on is also not possible, at least for me. As it's my work laptop, I shut it down once a week. But then, I can easily move this to a linux machine which is always powered.

Installing Tailscale is easy on this and the clawdbot can then talk to your other devices.

Main thing that gives me peace of mind is that the agent doesn't have all my sensitive data and it can manage it's own computer, be it virtual.
